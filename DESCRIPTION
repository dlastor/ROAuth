Package: ROAuth
Title: R interface for OAuth
Description: This package provides an interface to the OAuth 1.0
        specification, allowing users to authenticate via OAuth to the
        server of their choice.
        It provides an S4 OAuthCredentials class and also an OAuth
        reference-based class. The S4 approach is preferred.
        Having created the OAuthCredentials object (via oauth),
        one completes the handshake to grant permission and
        obtain an access token (key and secret).  These can then
        be used to make OAuth-enticated HTTP requests to access privileged
        data using the OAuthRequest function.
