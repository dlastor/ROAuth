[Low] Merge reference class' OAuthRequest function with the one
      in ROauth.R

           It is a pretty simple function.

Use OAuthCredentials as a single field in the reference class
so we can avoid 

[Done] writefunction option for oauthPUT, DELETE, etc.

[Okay] Make the $ method for OAuthCredentials use oauthPUT, etc. 
  rather than its own function.

   oauthCommand() handles writefunction and upload for PUT, etc.
   so all is fine.

Split the verify part of authorize()/handshake() into its own function.
